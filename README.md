University of Toledo Senior Design Project
Name: Speech-to-rext attachment for glasses
Group: Hunter Pion, Hunter Spino, Max Tiefenbach, Ramiro Garcio, Justin Lambdin

This is the embedded code for our project. This code will run on the esp32 microcontroller that will be controlling our device.
The code requires our mobile application https://github.com/ramiroxgarcia/SpeechToTextDisplayApp.git.

The code will interface with the mobile application using serial over bluetooth. The mobile application will pass strings to this application which
will be processed and displayed on the device.
